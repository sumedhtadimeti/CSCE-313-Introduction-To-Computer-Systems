Howdy,

These are my projects and assignments for CSCE 313 taught by D. Ahmead at Texas A&M Univesity.

While this code is open for the public to see it should not be plagiarized by any students taking the class.
All students should follow the Aggie Honor Code. The purpose of these uploads is to build 
my coding portfolio for my professional growth, and not as a resource for other students to cheat or plagiarize.

Thank you for your understanding. All the best!
